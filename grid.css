/* 2.1 Life Before Grid
Prior to introduction of Grid, it was very hard to make columns and rows with just flexbox;
You would need to consider many things considering below;
wrap, direction, etc.;
Even with all that, it was still tough to form grid;
Thus Grid was introduced;
*/

/* 2.2 CSS Grid Basic Concepts 
Just like Flexbox, Grid happens on the father element;
most things will happen on the father;
with property grid-template-columns, we can make number of columns by assigning width;
grid-template-rows will set height of rows of the grid;
if you give auto instead of width or height, the element will take all remaining space;
You can set gap between columns and rows with column-row and row-gap;
If you want universal gap, use property gap;
*/

/* 2.3 Grid Template Areas
Grid has function repeat();
When creating columns and rows, you can use it as : repeat(number of columns or rows, width or height);
grid-template-areas helps you visually design your grid from CSS;
After making each row in "" on the father; you can assign grid-area property to the children;
If you want to certain space empty, replace area name with a dot;
*/

/* 2.4 Rows and Columns
By assigning to the children grid-column-start & grid-column-end, 
you can determine from which line to which line the element will extend;
Same goes for grid-row-start & grid-row-end;
What you need to keep in mind is that these properties use "line" instead of column & row number;
*/

/* 2.5 Shortcuts
You can use shortcut grid-column: start number / end number
instead of using grid-column-start & grid-column-end;
Of course same goes for grid-row;
If end number === end line, you can use -1 instead of actual end line;
Instead of start / end, you can replace with span followed by number of cells;
You can also combine start / end with span;
