/* 2.1 Life Before Grid
Prior to introduction of Grid, it was very hard to make columns and rows with just flexbox;
You would need to consider many things considering below;
wrap, direction, etc.;
Even with all that, it was still tough to form grid;
Thus Grid was introduced;
*/

/* 2.2 CSS Grid Basic Concepts 
Just like Flexbox, Grid happens on the father element;
most things will happen on the father;
with property grid-template-columns, we can make number of columns by assigning width;
grid-template-rows will set height of rows of the grid;
You can set gap between columns and rows with column-row and row-gap;
If you want universal gap, use property gap;
