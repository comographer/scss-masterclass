/* 3.1 Variables and Nesting
In order to create variables files in SCSS, you should create a file with underscore in front of the file name;
Underscore means that file will not be compiled;
In the _variables file, you can make a varialble as below;
$variableName: variableValue;
To import _variables file: @import "_variables";
Once imported, you can use those variables with $variableName;
Nesting helps you target your elements more precisely;
If you have many same elements without classname,
you can target certain element in certain element by nesting them like properties;
You can also nest status such as hover: $:hover {}; 
*/

/* 3.2 Mixins
Mixins allows you to use SCSS functionality;
Just like _variables you create a file _mixins.scss;
To create a mixin: @mixin mixinName() {};
inside of the curly brackets, you right your SCSS;
After importing _mixins to your main SCSS file, you can use the mixin as so: @include mixinName();
As usage form of mixins looks like a function, they can actually take variables;
You can also use @if & @else inside a mixin;
